      "Mobility is the value a passer brings with their legs. This can mean running to extend passing plays, giving more time for the recievers to get open, or simply running with the ball themselves. While rushing yardage or sack count is a good measure, the best way to evaulate this trait is to watching to see how a passer deals with pressure and how frequently they get tackled when they chosoe to run.",

      "Accuracy is a passer's ability to consistency throw the football into the hands of their receiver. Accuracy can also be broken down into different areas of the field like short and deep, or in the middle or along the sidelines. A consistent passer should be accurate in all of these areas, while also hitting their target in stride, allowing the receiver to make a play after the catch.",

This crucially involves what they process before the play based on where the defenders are lined up, and after the snap. Additionally, making good decisions based on that information and properly reacting to pressure or the lack thereof.",
